We recommend using our SDKs where possible. We currently have SDKs for Python and Node.js, so if you're developing in either of these languages, you may benefit from using our SDKs over native solutions.

### Advantages
- Conversation parsing
- Batch support
- File uploads
- Skill shortcuts
- Error handling (coming soon...)
