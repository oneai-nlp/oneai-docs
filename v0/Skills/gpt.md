> ðŸ“˜ Integrate GPT skill into One AIâ€™s pipeline in order to:
> 
> - BUILD EFFICIENT AND DYNAMIC PROMPTS BY ONLY USING THE RELEVANT DATA
> 
> Dynamically build short and efficient prompts, providing cut costs and reduced response times. Extract highlights or summaries from input text using One AI's Language Skills, and feed only the relevant data to GPT.  
> This process has several advantages, including support for unlimited input length, cost and runtime efficiency, and the ability to select only relevant input for GPT based on specific Skills like sentiment, action-items, sales-insights, and more.
> 
> - GIVE GPT CONTEXT FROM YOUR KNOWLEDGE BASE
> 
> With One AI's clustering analytics engine, businesses can power their GPT apps with their knowledge base. The analytics engine enables businesses to search their knowledge base by meaning and find the most relevant articles, which can then be attached to the GPT prompts as context. With all the relevant information present, GPT will provide factually accurate responses.
> 
> - MONITOR GENERATED TEXT
> 
> Postprocess and analyze text generated by GPT to monitor and to assure compliance. Use Skills such as Topics, Names to validate that the relevant subjects are included in the text, or Sentiment and Emotions to make sure that GPT's replies are compliant and have an appropriate tone.

GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a family of natural language processing models that use deep learning techniques to generate coherent and grammatically correct text. The models are "pre-trained" because they are first trained on large amounts of text data, such as Wikipedia articles, to learn patterns in language.

Here are some example use-cases to what can be done using GPT skill along with One AI pipeline:

| Input                                                            | One AI Processing                                            | GPT Prompt                                              | Notes                                                                                                         |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 100K blog posts                                                  | Extract blog highlights                                      | Write a summary based on only the highlights            | ~80% input length reduction compared to using the full text                                                   |
| 1M product reviews                                               | Detect sentences with positive or negative sentiment         | Write a pros/cons section for the product               | Reduced noise, which will result in more accurate and focused responses                                       |
| Knowledge-base of 100K articles and a question written by a user | Find the most relevant article to answer the user's question | Write an answer based on the information in the article | GPT has the needed context to answer the question, which will result in much more accurate & useful responses |

Choose the model to be used in the pipeline: 

1. "text-davinci-003" - Most capable GPT-3 model. Can do any task the other models can do, often with higher quality
2. "text-curie-001" - Very capable, faster and lower cost than Davinci.
3. "text-babbage-001" - Capable of straightforward tasks, very fast, and lower cost
4. "text-ada-001" - Capable of very simple tasks, usually the fastest model in the GPT-3 series, and lowest cost
