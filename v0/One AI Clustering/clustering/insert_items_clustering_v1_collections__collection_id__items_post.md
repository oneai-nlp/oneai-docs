slug: "insert_items_clustering_v1_collections__collection_id__items_post"
excerpt: "This endpoint is used both for adding items to an existing collection, by passing in an existing `collection_id`, or for creating new collections, by passing an unknown `collection_id`, which will then be created before being populated with items.\n\n`collection_id` is an arbitrary string for your convenience. It is recommended that you choose something meaningful such as “support-tickets”, or “articles-headlines” based on the context of your input.\n\nAny item will be automatically associated with a cluster, unless you want to force a creation of a new cluster to accommodate this item, or to manually select the cluster you think is best appropriate."
